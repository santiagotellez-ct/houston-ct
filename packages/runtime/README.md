# @houston/engine (TypeScript)

The new Houston engine — a single-workspace, single-user agent runtime built on
[`pi-coding-agent`](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi). It owns the agent loop
in-process (no provider CLIs) and talks to providers directly via `pi-ai`.

**MVP status:** log in with your Claude Code (Anthropic) subscription via OAuth,
then chat with the agent. Streaming over SSE. Runs on Node via pnpm/tsx in dev and Docker.

## Run it

```bash
pnpm install
cd packages/runtime

# Point it at a working directory the agent may read/edit, then start:
HOUSTON_WORKSPACE_DIR="$HOME/some/project" pnpm dev
```

The engine is API-only (REST + SSE) with no built-in UI. Drive it with the webapp
(`pnpm --filter houston-web dev`) or the typed client
([`@houston/runtime-client`](../runtime-client)), both pointed at
`http://127.0.0.1:4317`. To wire up a login from scratch:

1. `POST /auth/anthropic/login` → returns a Claude login URL; open it.
2. Authorize with your Claude Pro/Max subscription. The engine catches the
   callback on `localhost:53692` and stores the token (auto-refreshed); poll
   `GET /auth/status` until `configured: true`. (Headless engines use a
   copy-paste code instead — see below.)
3. `POST /conversations/:id/messages` and stream the agent's reply (and tool
   calls like `read`/`ls`/`bash`) from `GET /conversations/:id/events`.

### Claude login (setup token)

The direct OAuth PKCE replay against Anthropic is server-blocked (2026-04), so
Claude connects via the sanctioned setup-token flow: `POST /auth/anthropic/login`
returns a `{ kind: "auth_code", url, instructions }`, the webapp opens the URL, and
the user pastes their `sk-ant-oat01…` setup token (from `claude setup-token`) or an
`sk-ant-api03…` console key back via `POST /auth/anthropic/login/complete`. The
token is stored as an `api_key` credential (pi-ai auto-detects the `sk-ant-oat`
prefix and uses Claude Code Bearer headers). No loopback and no `HOUSTON_HEADLESS`
mode. Codex stays device-code. See `src/auth/anthropic-setup-token.ts`.

## Config (env)

| Var | Default | Meaning |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `HOUSTON_WORKSPACE_DIR` | `cwd` | Directory the agent operates in |
| `HOUSTON_DATA_DIR` | `~/.houston-ts/data` | `auth.json` + conversation JSONL |
| `HOUSTON_HOST` / `HOUSTON_PORT` | `127.0.0.1` / `4317` | Bind address |
| `HOUSTON_MODEL` | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Anthropic model id (optional; built-in default) |
| `HOUSTON_RUNTIME_TOKEN` | _(unset)_ | Bearer token; unset = open (local dev) |
| `HOUSTON_CORS_ORIGIN` | `*` | Allowed CORS origin for the webapp |
| `HOUSTON_SKILLS_DIR` | `<workspace>/.agents/skills` | SKILL.md skills dir (Agent Skills standard); absent dir = no skills |
| `HOUSTON_SYSTEM_PROMPT` | _(built-in)_ | Product system prompt injected by the host/app |
| `HOUSTON_RUNTIME_LOG_FILE` | `<HOUSTON_DATA_DIR>/runtime.log` | Structured local log file, append-only |
| `HOUSTON_RUNTIME_LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | Minimum level: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, or `ERROR` |
| `HOUSTON_RUNTIME_PRINT_LOGS` | _(unset)_ | Set `1` to also print structured logs to stderr |

The agent also reads the workspace-root context file (`AGENTS.md` else
`CLAUDE.md`, root only — never ancestor directories) as its role/instructions.

### Local logging

Runtime logs are dependency-free structured key-value lines:

```text
timestamp=2026-01-02T03:04:05.006Z level=INFO run=... message="Session started" requestId=req-1
```

The runtime always appends to the local log file. To see the same structured
lines in a terminal while running the engine:

```bash
HOUSTON_RUNTIME_PRINT_LOGS=1 HOUSTON_RUNTIME_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG pnpm dev
```

## Deploy The Runtime (Docker / VPS)

`Dockerfile` is the only supported pi-runtime image. It runs the TypeScript
runtime on Node with pnpm-installed dependencies, with `git` + `python3`
available for the agent's shell tools. Keep this as the supported path rather
than a compiled-binary image: cloud turn mode, standalone server mode, stack
traces, and dependency resolution all share one deploy contract.

This image is the lower-level single-workspace runtime used by cloud and by the
host. To run the full Houston app behind HTTPS with the host + web app, use
[`../../selfhost`](../../selfhost) instead.

```bash
cd packages/runtime
cp .env.example .env                 # set HOUSTON_RUNTIME_TOKEN (openssl rand -hex 32)
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose logs -f
```

The agent's working directory is the `houston-workspace` volume (`/workspace`);
swap it for a bind mount in `docker-compose.yml` to point at a real project.
Auth + transcripts persist in the `houston-data` volume (`/data`). The container
runs as the non-root `node` user (uid 1000) — named volumes inherit that
ownership automatically, but a bind mount keeps its host ownership, so make it
writable by uid 1000 first (e.g. `chown -R 1000:1000 /srv/my-project`).

**Build context note.** The build context is the repo root, not
`packages/runtime` — the runtime links sibling workspace packages through pnpm.
Compose handles this; for a raw build run it from the
repo root:

```bash
docker build -f packages/runtime/Dockerfile -t houston/pi-runtime .
```

**Security (read before exposing it).** With no token the runtime is fully open,
and a caller can make the agent run shell commands in the workspace and spend
your Claude subscription. On a VPS:

- **Always set `HOUSTON_RUNTIME_TOKEN`** (compose refuses to start without it).
  Pass it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- The container is the trust boundary for the agent's `bash` tool — don't
  bind-mount sensitive host paths as the workspace.
- Put a TLS-terminating reverse proxy (Caddy, nginx) in front; the engine speaks
  plain HTTP. For the streaming endpoint (`POST /conversations/:id/messages`),
  **disable response buffering** so SSE flushes (nginx: `proxy_buffering off;`).
  Caddy streams correctly by default — a `reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:4317` is
  enough.

**Logging in on a VPS.** A non-loopback `HOUSTON_HOST` auto-enables the headless
copy-paste login (see "Headless login" above), since a remote browser can't reach
the engine's `127.0.0.1:53692` loopback. **Claude** → start login, authorize in
your browser, then paste the code back (`POST /auth/anthropic/login/complete`);
**Codex** → device code (`POST /auth/openai-codex/login`, enter the code on your
own device).

## Webapp integration

The engine exposes a REST + SSE API for the standalone webapp. Contract + typed
client: **[`@houston/runtime-client`](../runtime-client)**; full spec:
**[`docs/engine-api.md`](docs/engine-api.md)**.

Endpoints: `GET /health`, `GET /version`, `GET /providers`, `PUT /settings`,
`GET /auth/status`, `POST /auth/:provider/login` · `/login/complete` · `/logout`
(`:provider` = `anthropic` | `openai-codex`), `GET /conversations`,
`GET|POST /conversations/:id/messages` (POST streams SSE),
`POST /conversations/:id/cancel`. CORS is enabled (`HOUSTON_CORS_ORIGIN`, default `*`).

Both subscription logins work: **Claude** (`anthropic` — loopback locally, copy-paste
`auth_code` when headless) and **Codex** (`openai-codex`, device code). Pick the chat
model via `PUT /settings`.
