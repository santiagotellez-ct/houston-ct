/**
 * Build the full-replace `systemPrompt` string for a Claude session: Houston's
 * own prompt followed by the workspace-root context file when present.
 *
 * This mirrors `session/resource-loader.ts` (which builds the equivalent for pi):
 * the context file is read ONLY from the workspace root, never from an ancestor
 * directory, so a CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md sitting OUTSIDE the workspace can't leak in
 * past the file-tool clamp. The result is passed as a plain string to the SDK
 * (not the `claude_code` preset), so the agent sees exactly this and nothing the
 * SDK would otherwise discover on disk.
 *
 * `resource-loader.ts` keeps its loader private (it hands pi a `ResourceLoader`,
 * not a string), so the root-only candidate list is mirrored here rather than
 * imported — the two must stay in step.
