/**
 * The in-flight conversation snapshot and its reducer — wire-level semantics
 * shared by every event fan-out point (the runtime's bus, the control plane's
 * turn relay). A late/reconnecting subscriber is caught up with a `sync` frame
 * built from this; the reducer defines exactly what that frame contains.
 *
 * `seq` is the stream's watermark: the seq of the last frame folded in (0 when
 * nothing was ever published). It survives turn end — the per-conversation seq
 * counter is process-lifetime — so a `sync` frame always tells the client
 * where the stream currently stands, and a resume cursor can be judged
 * against it.
 *
 * `turnId` is the RUNNING turn's id (see `WireFrame.turnId`): set by the
 * turn's `user` frame, carried while the turn is live, cleared by the terminal
 * frame. It rides into the `sync` frame's data so a connecting client knows
 * WHICH turn is running, and it is what the relay's dead-pump reaper stamps on
 * the terminal frame it synthesizes.

/**
 * Fold a wire frame into the running snapshot. Pure. `partial` tracks only
 * assistant *text* (enough to redraw the in-flight bubble); tool/thinking
 * frames keep the turn marked running without touching it. `seq` advances to
 * the frame's seq (kept as-is for an unsequenced event) — including on the
 * terminal frames, so the watermark outlives the turn. `turnId` is adopted
 * from the frames (a `user` frame starts a new turn, so its id — possibly
 * absent on a legacy frame — REPLACES the previous one) and dropped with the
 * terminal frame; `undefined` fields are omitted so the snapshot serializes
 * without noise.
