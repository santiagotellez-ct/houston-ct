# Client architecture — the three-surface contract

**Load this FIRST, before touching any client code.** It is the maintenance
contract for Houston's multi-surface client: how behavior, look, and structure
stay identical across surfaces while each surface stays platform-native. Act
from the procedures below; they are checklists, follow them verbatim.

---

## The model (read this screen, then act)

Houston runs on **three surfaces**: **web** and **desktop** (React, shipping
today; desktop is the same `app/src` React tree in a Tauri shell) and the coming
native **iOS** (SwiftUI) and **Android** (Jetpack Compose) apps. They share three
things and deliberately differ in a fourth:

| One… | Lives in | Means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **behavior implementation** | `@houston/sdk` (`packages/sdk`) | what a client *does* — turn lifecycle, state, reconnection, commands — is written **once**, headless. |
| **look source** | design tokens (`packages/design-tokens`) | every colour/type/space/motion value is one token, compiled to CSS + TS + Swift + Kotlin. |
| **structural contract** | component inventory (`design/inventory`) | which components exist and their anatomy/states/semantics, CI-checked per surface. |

**What deliberately DIFFERS per surface:** form, navigation, and idiom. A
SwiftUI nav stack, a Compose bottom bar, a desktop split-pane — platform-native
is a *feature*, not drift. The **model of the world is identical** (same
view-models, same tokens, same component contract); the *presentation* is native
to each platform. Never flatten a surface into a web port to save effort.

### Load-bearing invariants (violating one is the bug)

1. **No business logic in surface code.** Turn lifecycle, state folding,
   reconnection, and command semantics live in `@houston/sdk`. A surface binds
   view-models to native UI; it never re-implements them.
2. **No raw design literals.** No hardcoded hex/rgba/spacing in app or `ui/` CSS
   (or in native views). Reference a `--ht-*` token (or its Tailwind
   `--color-*`, or the native token constant).
3. **Nothing but JSON crosses the SDK surface.** Everything through
   `getSnapshot` / `subscribe` / `dispatch` / `on` is plain JSON — no functions,
   no class instances — so it survives structured-clone and the native bridge.
4. **The SDK's VM snapshots and `BRIDGE.md` are frozen contracts, evolved
   ADDITIVELY** — same discipline as protocol v3: consumers ignore unknown
   fields; producers only add optional fields; discriminated unions only gain
   members. A native host running a different minor version must never break.
   (`packages/sdk/BRIDGE.md` §4.)

## The map (each piece, its path, its README)

| Piece | Path | README | What lives there |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **SDK** | `packages/sdk` | `packages/sdk/README.md` | Headless client. **kernel** (`store.ts` scopes/snapshots, `commands.ts` registry, `ports.ts` injected capabilities, `sdk.ts` composition); **modules** (`session`, `agents`, `conversations`, `turns`); **`react/`** subpath (`@houston/sdk/react` — `useSdkSnapshot`, `useSdkEvent`); **`bridge/`** the shipped native-bridge dispatcher (`createBridge`) + embeddable IIFE bundle (`build:bridge` → `dist/houston-sdk.bridge.js`, gitignored) that backs `fetch`/`storage` natively over the pipe and self-shims JSC globals; **`BRIDGE.md`** its wire spec (§2.1 configure, §9 native ports, §10 host polyfills). |
| **Design tokens** | `packages/design-tokens` | `packages/design-tokens/README.md` | Two-tier DTCG JSON (`tokens/primitive` + `tokens/semantic` + `tokens/scale`) → Style Dictionary → committed `dist/` (`css/tokens.css`, `ts/tokens.ts`, `swift/HoustonTokens.swift`, `kotlin/HoustonTokens.kt`). |
| **Component inventory** | `design/inventory` | `design/inventory/README.md` | `inventory.yaml` (versioned cross-surface component spec) + `manifests/{web,ios,android}.yaml` (per-surface status) + `CHANGELOG.md`. Enforced by `scripts/check-parity.mjs` (`pnpm check:parity`). |
| **Fake host** | `packages/fake-host` | `packages/fake-host/README.md` | In-memory protocol-v3 host for UI/e2e tests. Built from the SAME `@houston/runtime-client` stream pieces as the real host, so it can't drift from the wire. Consumed by `packages/web` Playwright e2e. |
| **Runtime client** | `packages/runtime-client` | (source) | The **wire layer**: `HoustonEngineClient`, resumable streams (`resume.ts` `streamEventsResumable`, `replay.ts` `ReplayLog`, `stream-channel.ts` `StreamChannel`, `stitch.ts` `serveResumableStream`), snapshot reduction (`snapshot.ts`), and the workspace-global reactivity loop (`global-events.ts` `streamGlobalEvents`). Shared by the SDK, the web adapter, the host, and the fake host. |
| **Web engine-adapter seam** | `packages/web/src/engine-adapter` | (source headers) | The delegation seam — see below. |

### The engine-adapter delegation seam and its planned fate

`packages/web/src/engine-adapter/` is the drop-in replacement for
`@houston-ai/engine-client` (aliased in `vite.config.ts` in host/new-engine
mode), letting the whole desktop UI run on the host unchanged. Convergence says
**this adapter eventually dissolves into direct SDK consumption**
(`convergence/README.md` P6 / `final-cutover.md`).

**Already migrated INTO the SDK (adapter now delegates):**

- **Turn/feed machinery** — `engine-adapter/turn-stream.ts` calls the SDK's
  `streamTurn` / `observeConversation`; `engine-adapter/stream-registry.ts` is a
  compat re-export of the SDK's `StreamRegistry`.
- **The FeedOutput seam** — `engine-adapter/feed-output.ts` implements the SDK's
  `FeedOutput` interface (`packages/sdk/src/modules/turns/feed-output.ts`), bridging SDK
  pushes onto the desktop's in-process bus. The SDK folds each frame once; the
  output decides where it lands.
- **The global-events reactivity loop** — both the SDK's agents module and the
  web adapter consume the ONE `streamGlobalEvents` in `@houston/runtime-client`.

**Still adapter-side (not yet SDK):** the control-plane surface
(agents/activities/routines/skills/board/config CRUD — `client.ts`,
`control-plane.ts`, `activities.ts`, `agent-files.ts`), auth/token mirroring, and
the `synthetic.ts` old-id↔engine-id provider remapping. The SDK "wraps the
conversation/agent surface first; broader control-plane operations stay on their
current paths until migrated deliberately" (`packages/sdk/README.md`, *Out of
scope for v1*).

## THE PROCEDURES

### a. Behavior change (turn lifecycle, state, reconnection, VM fields) → SDK first

Behavior is **never** written in surface code. Change it in the SDK, then bind.

1. **Locate the module** in `packages/sdk/src/modules/`: `session` (connection /
   token), `agents` (agent list), `conversations` (per-agent conversation LIST,
   scope `conversations/<agentId>`), `turns` (the live feed VM, scope
   `conversation/<id>`). Wire-level stream/reconnect changes may instead belong
   in `packages/runtime-client` (see the decision table, procedure f).
2. **Make the change once**, in the module or `runtime-client`. Keep the kernel
   pure JSON: no functions or class instances in a snapshot or command payload.
3. **Tests are mandatory and are part of the contract:**
   - **Unit** — the module's `*.test.ts` (e.g. `turns/turn-settle.test.ts`,
     `turns/vm-output.test.ts`).
   - **Wire contract** — if you touched the stream/resume surface, the web
     Playwright e2e runs the UI against `@houston/fake-host`, which is built from
     the same `@houston/runtime-client` pieces, so a wire mismatch fails there
     (`pnpm --filter houston-web test:e2e`).
   - **VM snapshot changes ARE contract changes.** A change to `ConversationVM`
     (`feed`, `running`, `sessionStatus`, `boardStatus`) or any published
     snapshot is a change to what every surface and the native bridge observes.
     Treat it exactly like a protocol change: **additive only** (procedure e /
     `BRIDGE.md` §4). Update the VM's own tests AND, if the shape changed, the
     `BRIDGE.md` feed-semantics section.
4. **Then surfaces bind.** Web/desktop consume the VM via the engine-adapter bus
   bridge today (or `@houston/sdk/react` hooks once wired). No surface
   re-derives the behavior.
5. **The web adapter seam:** if the behavior is in the turn/feed path, the
   adapter picks it up automatically — it *delegates* to the SDK
   (`engine-adapter/turn-stream.ts`). Only touch the adapter if you changed the
   `FeedOutput` interface itself.
6. **Mobile picks it up via the bridge.** iOS/Android never import TS UI; they
   embed the SDK in a JS engine and speak the `BRIDGE.md` JSON wire. A new VM
   field reaches them as an **additional optional field** on the pushed
   `snapshot` — no bridge version bump, no host change (`BRIDGE.md` §4). A
   breaking VM change (removed/renamed/retyped field) requires a bridge major
   `v` bump and is essentially never the right move — make it additive.

> **`sessionStatus` vs `boardStatus` — read the pair, not one.** A user Stop (and
> a logged-out provider) settles `sessionStatus === "error"` but
> `boardStatus === "needs_you"`. A surface keying off `sessionStatus` alone
> renders a normal Stop as a red failure. `boardStatus` is the handled-vs-error
> signal: `needs_you` = handled / your attention, `error` = genuine failure.
> (`packages/sdk/src/modules/turns/vm-output.ts`.)

### b. Visual change → tokens procedure

A visual change is a **token edit**, never a literal. (Full detail:
`packages/design-tokens/README.md`; `knowledge-base/design-system.md`.)

1. Edit the JSON under `packages/design-tokens/tokens/` — a primitive value
   (`tokens/primitive/*.json`, the only place a literal hex/rgba lives) or a
   semantic reference (`tokens/semantic/color.{light,dark}.json`). **Never edit
   `dist/`. Never add a new hardcoded colour/spacing literal** to app or `ui/`
   CSS — reference a `--ht-*` var or a Tailwind `--color-*` utility.
2. `pnpm --filter @houston/design-tokens build` — regenerates all four `dist/`
   surfaces (CSS/TS/Swift/Kotlin) at once.
3. **Commit source + regenerated `dist/` together.** `test/sync.test.ts`
   rebuilds to a temp dir on every `pnpm test` and fails if the committed `dist/`
   is stale, so you can't forget.
4. If the change is intentionally *visual* (a real colour move), update
   `test/legacy-resolved.json` to the new baseline in the same commit — otherwise
   `test/zero-diff.test.ts` (correctly) fails.

### c. Structural / component change → inventory bump (same PR)

A component added, removed, or restructured (new part, new state, changed
semantics) is a structural change. (Full detail: `design/inventory/README.md`.)

1. Edit `design/inventory/inventory.yaml` — add or modify the component entry
   (only genuinely cross-surface components belong; see the README *Scope*).
2. **Bump `version`.**
3. **Add a matching `## vN` entry to `design/inventory/CHANGELOG.md`** (a bump
   without a changelog entry is a hard `check:parity` fail).
4. **Update every *enforced* surface manifest in the SAME PR** — `web.yaml` is
   enforced (`enforced: true`); it may not leave a component with
   `since <= inventoryVersion` `not-started`. Use `partial` + a `notes` if it
   only half-lands.
5. **Unenforced surfaces (iOS/Android) catch up later.** As a native app
   implements a component, flip its status and raise that manifest's
   `inventoryVersion`. `check:parity` prints their lag but never fails on them.
6. **Flip `enforced: true`** for a surface only when its app *ships* at that
   inventory version.
7. `pnpm check:parity` must pass.

### d. New cross-surface feature

1. **Capabilities gate.** If the feature is conditional (profile/plan/platform),
   gate it on `/v1/capabilities` (`convergence/README.md` — capabilities
   replace "am I web/desktop" branches), not a surface fork.
2. **Inventory entry.** Any new user-facing component → procedure c.
3. **SDK module / commands.** New behavior → a module command + snapshot in
   `packages/sdk` → procedure a. Reads are snapshots keyed by scope; writes are
   commands in the registry (duplicate command `type` throws — a wiring bug).
4. **Per-surface UI.** Each surface binds the view-model to native UI, native in
   form. Same model, native presentation.
5. **Deliberately single-surface feature** (desktop-only chrome — menu bars,
   split panes, file tree, cron editor): **do NOT inventory it** (inventory
   *Scope* excludes desktop-only surfaces). Build it in `app/` (or the relevant
   surface) and gate it on the capability/platform so other surfaces cleanly
   omit it. Single-surface is fine when it's *intended*; the inventory exists to
   catch the *accidental* skip.

### e. Wire / protocol change

1. **Protocol v3 is additive.** Consumers ignore unknown fields; producers add
   only optional fields; discriminated unions only gain members
   (`convergence/README.md`; `BRIDGE.md` §4). Never change a field's type or
   meaning.
2. **Contract docs live in code:** wire types + zod in
   `packages/protocol/src/wire.ts`; the provider-error taxonomy in
   `packages/protocol/src/provider-error.ts`; the resumable-stream contract
   (`seq`, `turnId`, resume cursor, `resync`) in `wire.ts` and implemented in
   `packages/runtime-client` (`replay.ts` / `stream-channel.ts` / `stitch.ts`).
   The native-bridge projection of all of it is `packages/sdk/BRIDGE.md` — update
   it in the same PR when the wire shape a host observes changes.
3. **Cross-repo obligation.** If you change the gateway↔engine surface (routes,
   auth, engine-pod env contract), update the sibling `cloud` repo's
   `INTEGRATION.md` in the same task (workspace `CLAUDE.md` → *Cross-repo
   changes*). The wire contract cloud consumes IS Houston's protocol v3.

### f. Where NEW client code goes (decision table)

| Put it in… | When |
| --- | --- |
| **`packages/sdk`** | Client *behavior*: turn lifecycle, state folding, reconnection semantics, a view-model, a command. Anything a native surface must observe identically. Headless, JSON-only. |
| **`packages/runtime-client`** | The *wire*: HTTP/SSE transport, resumable-stream sequencing/replay, snapshot reduction, the global-events loop. Below the SDK; shared by SDK + adapter + host + fake-host. |
| **`ui/` (`@houston-ai/*`)** | A *generic, reusable* React component. **Props only — no store/Zustand/Tauri imports, no `app/` types (use generic `BoardItem`/`FeedItem`/`ChatMessage`), no `@/` aliases, i18n-agnostic (`labels?` props with English defaults).** (`CLAUDE.md` → Library boundary.) |
| **`app/` (= `packages/web`)** | *App-specific* composition: wiring `ui/` components to SDK view-models, i18n `t()` injection, routing, desktop chrome. Unsure whether it's generic? Start in `app/`, extract to `ui/` later. |
| **`packages/web/src/engine-adapter`** | Only the `@houston-ai/engine-client` compatibility shim and control-plane surface not yet migrated to the SDK. **Prefer the SDK** — the adapter is shrinking, not growing (procedure a; `convergence/README.md` P6). |

## Known deferred items (honest, from merged reality)

- **Engine-adapter migration is unfinished.** Turns/feed + the global-events
  loop are migrated into the SDK; control-plane CRUD, auth/token mirroring, and
  `synthetic.ts` provider id-remapping still live adapter-side. The adapter is
  deleted at the gated final cutover (`convergence/final-cutover.md`), not before.
- **React hooks await their first consumer.** `@houston/sdk/react`
  (`useSdkSnapshot`, `useSdkEvent`) ship and are tested, but nothing in
  `packages/web`/`app` consumes them yet — the web app still threads its client
  explicitly (`packages/web/src/new-engine/app.tsx`). No `SdkProvider`/`useSdk()`
  context by design; add one only when a real consumer needs it.
- **The native bridge is built.** `BRIDGE.md` fixes the wire; the JS-side
  dispatcher and its self-contained JavaScriptCore bundle
  (`packages/sdk/src/bridge/`, built to `packages/sdk/dist/houston-sdk.bridge.js`
  via `pnpm --filter @houston/sdk build:bridge`) exposing global
  `HoustonSdkBridge.create({ send })` now exist, with a bundle smoke test.
- **iOS has a built v1** at `mobile/ios/` (SwiftUI, iOS 17+, zero third-party
  packages) — a thin surface over `@houston/sdk` running in JavaScriptCore, with
  UI/copy/status parity governed by `mobile/PARITY.md`. Its manifest is still
  `enforced: false`, `inventoryVersion: 0` (built but not yet compiled+shipped —
  see `design/inventory/manifests/ios.yaml` for honest per-component statuses).
  Android remains all `not-started`. `check:parity` reports each surface's lag
  but never fails on them. The Swift token `dist/` output is consumed by the iOS
  app (synced into `mobile/ios/Houston/Generated/` at build time); Kotlin has no
  consumer yet.
- **Four web inventory `partial`s** (real structural gaps, extract-before-mobile):
  - `provider-error-card` — feed types + `ProviderError` taxonomy are shared, but
    the rendered cards are app/-locked (`app/src/components/shell/provider-error-cards/*`).
  - `mission-status-chip` — status rendering is triplicated across kanban-card,
    conversation-list, and review-item with divergent `RunStatus` enums; no
    shared chip yet.
  - `agent-list-item` — no single shared component; the row is composed in `app/`
    from generic nav + avatar primitives; aggregate status is app-side.
  - `skill-invocation-message` — the marker decode is shared, but the card render
    is composed in `app/`.
- **`sessionStatus`-vs-`boardStatus` nuance** (see procedure a) — a persistent
  trap: a Stop / logged-out provider is `sessionStatus: "error"` but
  `boardStatus: "needs_you"`. Always read the pair; never render red off
  `sessionStatus` alone.
