## Design tokens are the source of truth

Colour, typography scale, spacing, radii, motion and elevation are defined ONCE
in **`packages/design-tokens`** (`@houston/design-tokens`), authored as W3C DTCG
JSON (primitive layer + semantic `--ht-*` alias layer, light + dark) and compiled
by Style Dictionary to every surface: `dist/css/tokens.css` (web/desktop),
`dist/ts/tokens.ts` (JS values), `dist/swift/*.swift` + `dist/kotlin/*.kt`
(native, no consumers yet). `@houston-ai/core`'s `globals.css` imports the CSS;
`@theme` there re-exports `--ht-*` to Tailwind `--color-*` as before.

**Change procedure — a visual change is a token edit:**

1. Edit `packages/design-tokens/tokens/*.json` (a primitive value or a semantic
   reference). NEVER edit `dist/` and NEVER add a new hardcoded colour/spacing
   literal to app or `ui/` CSS — reference a `--ht-*` var (or a Tailwind
   `--color-*` utility).
2. `pnpm --filter @houston/design-tokens build`.
3. Commit source + regenerated `dist/` together (a sync test fails on stale dist).
4. If the change is genuinely visual, update `test/legacy-resolved.json` to the
   new baseline in the same commit (the zero-diff test pins it otherwise).

The colour values below are the CURRENT shipped tokens; treat the JSON as
authoritative. See `packages/design-tokens/README.md` for the two-tier model and
the zero-diff story.

## Personality
Capable, calm, invisible. Quiet expert. Not flashy, not corporate, not techy. Like texting brilliant assistant.

**Anti-references:** Jira, Linear, Notion. No dense toolbars. No keyboard-shortcut culture. No config overload.

## Principles
1. **Show, don't configure.** One obvious action per screen. No settings panels. Infer if possible.
2. **Always feel alive.** AI working → user sees movement every second. Silence = broken.
3. **Chat is interface.** Primary interaction. Everything else supports.
4. **Non-technical labels.** "Prompt" not "Description". "Needs You" not "In Review". Mom-test every word.
5. **Invisible borders, visible actions.** Borders 5-15% opacity. Action buttons (Start/Approve/Delete) always visible — never hover-only.

## Color
Near-black `#0d0d0d`, NEVER pure black. **Both light and dark ship** now (the
"light mode only" era is over — see Futuristic theme).

### Grays
`gray-50 #f9f9f9` (sidebar bg) · `100 #ececec` (hover, user bubble) · `200 #e3e3e3` (pressed, dividers) · `300 #cdcdcd` (borders) · `400 #b4b4b4` (disabled) · `500 #9b9b9b` (placeholder) · `600 #676767` (secondary text) · `700 #424242` (body) · `950 #0d0d0d` (primary text + buttons)

### Tokens
The semantic `--ht-*` set (re-exported to Tailwind `--color-*`) is generated from
`@houston/design-tokens` — see `tokens/semantic/color.{light,dark}.json` for the
live values. Historic light-mode reference: `--background #fff` · `--foreground
#0d0d0d` · `--secondary #f9f9f9` · `--muted-foreground #5d5d5d` · `--border
#e5e5e5` · `--ring #0d0d0d` · `--accent #f5f5f5` (the futuristic layer now shifts
several of these — the JSON is authoritative).

### Borders (opacity)
5%/15%/15%/25% = light/medium/heavy/xheavy. Use `rgba(13,13,13,X)`.

### Status
success `#00a240` · info `#0169cc` · warning `#e0ac00` · danger `#e02e2a`

### Color restraint
The monochrome discipline still holds for *content* (text, controls), but the
futuristic theme adds intentional **ambient brand colour** as chrome:
1. card-running-glow gradient (blue→indigo→orange→yellow) — the brand palette
2. the **aurora glow** behind dark mode (same blue/indigo/orange family)
3. the cool **Aurora** light palette (blue/indigo-tinted gutter + cards)
4. status indicators, agent/channel avatars, links

"Never decorative colour" is now scoped to *content surfaces*; the **chrome**
(window background, glass, glow) carries brand colour deliberately.

### Agent avatars
Use `HoustonAvatar` from `@houston-ai/core` for agent avatar badges. Resting
state = no border, gray background softly mixed with the agent color, colored
helmet glyph. Running state = same badge inside the comet glow. Resolve stored
semantic ids with `resolveAgentColor` from `@houston-ai/core`, not app-local
helpers, so desktop and mobile render same palette.

## Brand theming
Override `--color-primary` via globals.css. NEVER hardcode hex — always semantic token.

## Typography
System font stack. No webfonts.

| Element | Size | Weight | Tailwind |
|---------|------|--------|----------|
| h1 | 28px | 400 | `text-[28px]` |
| model selector | 18px | 400 | `text-lg` |
| body/input | 16px | 400 | `text-base` |
| buttons | 14px | 500 | `text-sm font-medium` |
| sidebar items | 14px | 400 | `text-sm` |
| small labels | 12px | 400 | `text-xs` |

Section headers: sentence case, never uppercase/tracking-wider. `text-sm font-medium`.

## Buttons
Pill shape (`rounded-full`) everywhere.

- **Primary:** `bg-gray-950 text-white rounded-full h-9 px-3 text-sm font-medium hover:bg-gray-800`
- **Secondary:** `bg-white text-gray-950 rounded-full h-9 px-3 border border-black/15 hover:bg-gray-50`
- **Ghost:** `bg-transparent rounded-lg w-9 h-9 hover:bg-[#f3f3f3]`
- **Soft chip:** `bg-gray-100 rounded-full h-9 px-3 hover:bg-gray-200`
- **Large:** `h-11 px-4`

## Composer (signature)
`max-w-3xl rounded-[28px] bg-white p-2.5` + multi-shadow:
```
0 4px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.04),
0 4px 80px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.04),
0 0 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.62)
```
Grid: leading (attach) | primary (text) | trailing (send).

## Messages
- **User:** `ml-auto max-w-[70%] rounded-3xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-5 py-2.5`
- **Assistant:** no bubble. Plain markdown, left-aligned, transparent.

## Cards
White bg, `border-black/5`, `rounded-xl`, hover shadow. Running state = `card-running-glow` animation border.

### RowCard (inline notice + integration cards)
One shared component (`app/src/components/cards/row-card.tsx`) for the compact horizontal cards in chat and integration surfaces: monochrome logo/icon left (`size-8 rounded-lg` media box), `text-[13px]` title + `text-[11px]` muted description, single right-side action slot. Always grey `bg-secondary`, `rounded-xl`, `px-3 py-2.5`. The `inline` prop renders a `<span>` row so it can sit inside assistant markdown prose; `size="md"` gives a roomier modal-heading variant. Pair with `RowCardButton` (`h-7 rounded-full` pill) — its `icon` is **optional**, so action buttons are text-only by default (only the Composio cards pass a trailing link icon), and it is built on `AsyncButton` (HOU-465 rage-click guard). The media slot takes either a `ProviderGlyph` (`shell/provider-logos.tsx`) — monochrome, never full-color brand marks, keyed by provider id with an initial fallback — or a lucide icon. Used by: reconnect / sign-in (`UnauthenticatedCard`, `ProviderReconnectCard`), rate-limit (`RateLimitedCard`, clock icon), the provider-switch dialog, and the Composio sign-in / link cards. Multi-button error cards stay on `ErrorCard` (icon-bubble) in `provider-error-cards/shared.tsx`.

## Empty states
`Empty` from `@houston-ai/core`. Big `text-2xl font-semibold` title + description + optional action. No icon-in-box. Container must be `flex flex-col` for `flex-1 justify-center`.

## Progress panel
`ProgressPanel` from `@houston-ai/chat`. Agent calls `update_progress({steps})`. States: pending (empty circle) / active (spinner + highlight) / done (green check). Header: "X of Y steps complete". Renders right-side alongside ChatPanel.

## Layout

```
+----------+---------------+-------------+
| Sidebar  | Tab Bar       | Right Panel |
| 200px    |---------------| (optional)  |
|          | Main Content  |             |
+----------+---------------+-------------+
```

Sidebar 200px `#f5f5f5`. Right panel 45% width, 380px min. Split view resizable, default 55/45. Chat max-width 768px (`max-w-3xl`). Header 52px.

### Radii
`rounded` (0.25rem chips) · `rounded-md` (inputs) · `rounded-lg` (sidebar items, icon btns) · `rounded-xl` (cards) · `rounded-2xl` (large cards, dialogs) · `rounded-[28px]` (composer) · `rounded-full` (pills, avatars)

### Button sizes
`h-9` standard · `h-11` large · `w-9 h-9` icon

## Shadows
Composer shadow = main depth cue. Else flat or 1px edge: `0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.05)`.

## Animation
- **card-running-glow** — rotating conic-gradient border. blue→indigo→orange→yellow. 2.5s infinite. Comet tail.
- **Framer Motion (Board):** enter `opacity:0, y:8` → `opacity:1, y:0`. Exit `y:-8`. Duration 0.2s, easing `[0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1]`. `AnimatePresence` with `popLayout`.
- **Spring preferred:** `{type:"spring", stiffness:300, damping:30, mass:1}`.
- **typing-bounce** — 3-dot indicator, vertical translate + opacity.
- **tool-pulse** — pulsing dot, 1s, active tool calls.

Duration: fast 0.2s / common 0.667s / bounce 0.833s / elegant 0.582s. Under 0.3s for interactions.

Rules: `layout` prop on reordering items. `AnimatePresence mode="popLayout"` for lists. Spring > CSS easing.

## Icons
Lucide React only. 20px standard (`h-5 w-5`), 16px small, 24px large. Stroke 2px (or 1.5px lighter). `currentColor`.

**No emoji as icons.**

## Rules
1. No emoji icons
2. No hover-only affordances
3. Monochrome *content*; brand-coloured *chrome* (futuristic theme)
4. Compact not cramped
5. Animations serve purpose
6. Pill shapes for buttons (`rounded-full`)
7. Brand via tokens only — never hardcode hex

## Design skill workflow
1. `/critique` — before building
2. `/polish` — final alignment/spacing/consistency pass
Use when relevant: `/clarify` (UX copy), `/distill` (overloaded screen), `/animate` (micro-interactions), `/audit` (a11y, perf).

## Futuristic theme

The current desktop look. One revert-able layer, `app/src/styles/futuristic.css`
(delete its `@import` in `app/src/styles/globals.css` to fully revert), plus a
few targeted component/token changes. Surface colours route through `--ht-*`
tokens, re-exported to Tailwind as `--color-*`, so the theme is mostly token
overrides — not a 20-component rewrite.

**Arc / Zen "canvas" layout.** The main content floats as a rounded "screen"
card (`canvas-screen`) on a recessed **window gutter**; the sidebar is
transparent and melts into the gutter. Tokens: `--ht-canvas-gutter` (window bg)
and `--ht-canvas-screen` (the floating screen). The mission panel opens as a
second rounded card with a gutter gap.

**Dark mode** — the signature look: a multi-radial **aurora glow** on
`body::before` (blue/indigo/orange, slow 32s drift, disabled under
`prefers-reduced-motion`) + translucent **glass** surfaces (`.bg-card`,
`.bg-popover`, sidebar) with `backdrop-filter` blur.

**Light mode** — the cool, solid **"Aurora" palette** (no glow mesh — it read as
"glitter" over solid surfaces): gutter `#eef1f7`, screen `#fff`, cards `#f4f6fc`,
cool blue/indigo border. Clean and futuristic by restraint, not decoration.

**Primary button** — flat and sober (`[data-variant="default"]:is(button, a)`),
not a glossy slab. Kanban resting cards use one token, `--ht-card-rest` (`#2c2c2b`
dark / cool light), unified across resting + running + needs-you.

**Seamless title bar (macOS desktop only)** — `titleBarStyle: "Overlay"` +
`hiddenTitle`; the content extends to the top so the traffic lights float over
the app's own background (a transparent drag strip in `workspace-shell.tsx`,
gated to `osIsTauri() && isMac`). `applyTheme` also calls
`getCurrentWindow().setTheme()` so the native chrome tracks the app theme.
Capabilities: `core:window:allow-set-theme` + `…allow-start-dragging`.

**Tuning knobs** live as comments in `futuristic.css` (aurora alphas, glass
blur, `--ht-card-rest`, the canvas tokens). Dark mode is the loved baseline —
when adjusting, scope changes to light (`:root`) and pin dark
(`[data-theme="dark"]`) so it stays put.
